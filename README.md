# Requirements!

  - Python 2 or 3 Python can be downloaded from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  
  - Vagrant Vagrant is the software that configures the VM and lets you share     files        between your host computer and the VM's filesystem. Download it from [vagrantup.com](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). Install the version for your operating system.
  
  - VirtualBox VirtualBox is the software that actually runs the virtual         machine.      You can download it from virtualbox.org, [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Install the          platform package for your operating system. You do not need the extension pack or the SDK. You do       not need to launch VirtualBox after installing it; Vagrant will do that.
  
- Download the VM configuration
    There are a couple of different ways you can download the VM configuration.You can download and unzip this file: FSND-Virtual-Machine.zip This will give you a directory called FSND-Virtual-Machine. It may be located inside your Downloads folder.
    
    Alternately, you can use Github to fork and clone the repository https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm.
    
    Either way, you will end up with a new directory containing the VM files. Change to this directory in your terminal with cd. Inside, you will find another directory called vagrant. Change directory to the vagrant directory

-   From your terminal, inside the vagrant subdirectory, run the command
    vagrant up. This will cause Vagrant to download the Linux operating system and install it. This may take quite a while (many minutes) depending on how fast your Internet connection is.
    
-   When vagrant up is finished running, you will get your shell prompt back.
    At this point, you can run vagrant ssh to log in to your newly installed Linux VM!

### Running the project
